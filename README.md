# ðŸŽ¨ Art Gallery with Unsplash API

## Objective

The objective of this project was to create an image gallery leveraging the capabilities of the Unsplash API.

## Project Description

This Art Gallery project was primarily developed to showcase my proficiency in Nuxt3 and my adeptness with contemporary web technologies. By demonstrating these skills, my hope is to inspire confidence in potential employers and collaborators about the quality and efficiency of my work.

### Key Features:

- **Nuxt3 Integration:** This project is a testament to my skills in the latest version of Nuxt, Nuxt3. This modern framework aids in developing robust and efficient applications, and my implementation ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that has been instrumental in crafting the sleek, responsive design you see. It allowed for rapid development without sacrificing aesthetics or functionality.
- **Nuxt Image:** Efficient and size-optimized image rendering ensures faster load times and an enhanced user experience.
- **useState Composable:** For state management, the `useState` composable was employed to keep the application's data flow streamlined and maintainable.
- **LocalStorage Integration:** LocalStorage has been seamlessly integrated to allow users to save and track their favorite images across sessions, ensuring a personalized user experience for returning users.
- **Dynamic Routing with Nuxt:** The dynamic routing capabilities enable each image to have its own dedicated page, enhancing the SEO capabilities and overall shareability of the content.
- **Responsive Design:** With Tailwind CSS, the gallery is not only aesthetically pleasing but also fully responsive, ensuring users on all devices get a consistent viewing experience.
